TicTacToe and UltimateTicTacToe
===============================

Both games can be played in the terminal or with AI players.

The minimax and alphabeta AI players for normal TicTacToe are good - they will play perfectly.

For UltimateTicTacToe, the AI players are not as good. They can only plan 5-10 moves ahead, (depending on pruning) since the game tree is too large. And the heuristic is not great.
